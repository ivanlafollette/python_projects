# Your task here is very special: you must design a vowel eater! Write a program that uses:
# a for loop;
# the concept of conditional execution (if-elif-else)
# the continue statement.
# Your program must:

# ask the user to enter a word;
# use user_word = user_word.upper() to convert the word entered by the user to upper case; we'll talk about string methods and the upper() method very soon â€“ don't worry;
# use conditional execution and the continue statement to "eat" the following vowels A, E, I, O, U from the inputted word;
# print the uneaten letters to the screen, each one of them on a separate line.

print("We're going to ask you for a word, and all the vowels will be eaten. Ok? Great!")
print()
